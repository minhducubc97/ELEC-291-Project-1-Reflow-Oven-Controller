<b>Project-1-Reflow-Oven-Controller</b>

First Electrical Engineering project for ELEC 291 at UBC

In this project:
- I built circuits and programmed a Reflow Oven Controller, used for reflow soldering to assemble PCBs of STM components.
- I measured the temperature inside the oven with a thermocouple, plot the temperature as a function of time using python. The Controller will automatically cut off the power when the temperature exceeds a certain limit.
- Control AC state using Solid State Relay
